# Application
This code defines a RealtimeAPI functional component which interacts with a Firebase database to perform CRUD operations for items. It includes presentation components for modals and forms, as well as logic for handling deletion, creation, and updates of items, including real-time data fetching and sorting. The component also manages state for pagination and the modals' visibility.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
